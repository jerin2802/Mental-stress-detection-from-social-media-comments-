When a mental health issue occurs and its symptoms frequently stress out and impair
capacity to operate, it becomes a mental disease.Emotion plays a significant role in
daily interpersonal human interactions. This is Necessary to make rational as well as
intelligent decisions. It helps us to match and understand the feelings of others by
conveying our feelings and giving feedback to others. In prior studies, several modalities
have been explored to recognize the emotional states such as facial expressions [1],
speech [2], physiological signals [3], etc. Stress detection from the text of social media
is one of the most important and difficult tasks in the field of machine learning using
natural language processing. Feeling overwhelmed or more emotional can be a mental
disorder. Emotion recognition provides benefits to many institutions and aspects of life.
It is useful and important for security and healthcare purposes. We wish to work on this
topic emotion detection using NLP to address this issue and prevent any undesirable
situations from occurring. Natural language processing, machine learning techniques,
and neural network architectures to create, tune, and evaluate models that categorize
Reedit text comments as "Stressed" or "not-stressed."For this Reedit data set, we got 71%
F1-score by using machine learning models
